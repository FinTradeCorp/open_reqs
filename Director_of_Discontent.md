**Job Requisition: Director of Discontent**

_This is a live requisition. We are looking for the voice in the crowd, the person who plants the seeds of discontent and guides the right people to our door. This is a role for a digital propagandist with a sense of humor._

**Role / Title**

Director of Discontent

**Affiliation**

The FinTrade Corp Fight Club / r/satoshi_durden

**Background (The Ideal Candidate)**

You live and breathe online subcultures. You've seen communities rise and fall. You can tell the difference between authentic engagement and a soulless corporate marketing campaign from a mile away. Your post history is a masterclass in irony, and you've probably been temporarily banned from a forum or two for speaking a little too much truth.

You understand that the most powerful communities aren't built; they're cultivated. You know that a well-timed meme can be more effective than a press release, and that a sense of shared discovery is the most valuable currency on the internet. You are a digital shepherd for a flock of cynical sheep, and you know exactly what kind of grass they like to eat.

**Core Responsibilities (The "Narrative Function")**

Your job is to be the primary recruiter for our "digital fight club" and to stoke the fires of discontent that fuel our community.

* **Seed the Narrative:** You will be responsible for "leaking" our test episodes, trailers, and GitHub artifacts into the right corners of the internet (Reddit, X, etc.) under various anonymous personas.
* **Identify the Disenfranchised:** Your primary task is to read the comments. You will ignore the trolls and the passive consumers and identify the people who _get it_â€”the ones who share their own stories of corporate absurdity and technical debt.
* **Manage the Funnel:** You will subtly and skillfully guide these high-signal individuals from the public chaos of Reddit to the private, members-only "inner circle" on our Discord server.
* **Stoke the Flames:** You will be the primary moderator and conversation-starter in the subreddit and Discord. You will run polls, ask provocative questions, and turn "Project Mayhem" submissions into engaging community content. Your job is to keep the energy high and the cynicism sharp.

**Personality Beats (The "Culture Fit")**

* **Fluent in Irony:** Your default communication style is sarcasm. You are allergic to corporate PR-speak.
* **A Shitposter with a Purpose:** You understand how to use humor and memes to make a serious point.
* **A Master of Subtext:** You know how to craft a post that says one thing on the surface and another thing to the people who are paying attention.
* **Fiercely Protective:** You are the guardian of the community's authenticity. You will be responsible for sniffing out and shutting down any attempts by corporate marketers or "normies" to dilute the culture.

**Technical Stack (The "Visual Tags")**

* **Primary:** Reddit, Discord, X (formerly Twitter)
* **Secondary:** TikTok, Instagram (for the "universal frustration" phase)
* **Tools:** Canva/CapCut (for creating shareable video/image assets), a deep and encyclopedic knowledge of meme formats, and the art of the well-timed GIF.

**How to Apply**

Do not send a resume or a portfolio of your "engagement metrics." We don't care.

Your application is a practical test.

> 1	Go to a large, relevant subreddit (e.g., r/antiwork, r/ProgrammerHumor, r/mildlyinfuriating).

> 2	Create a new post that captures a common, real-world tech or corporate frustration.

> 3	Within your post or in the comments, you must subtly and cleverly guide readers to our Discord server. Do not just drop a link. Make it feel like a secret you're sharing.

> 4	Send a link to your post to the email address listed on the r/satoshi_durden subreddit. In your email, tell us how many people you think you successfully "recruited" and why.

We'll know if you're the right person for the job by the quality of your work.
