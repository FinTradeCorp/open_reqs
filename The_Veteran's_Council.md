**Call for Advisors: The Veteran's Council**

_This is an open call for a panel of technical advisors. We are not looking for full-time employees. We are looking for wisdom, stories, and the occasional sanity check from the people who built the world we now work in._

**Role / Title**

Senior Technical Advisor (Part-Time, Remote)

**Affiliation**

The FinTrade Corp Universe

**Who We're Looking For**

You've spent decades in the trenches. You survived the dot-com bust, you've lived through multiple platform migrations, and you've seen architectural principles sacrificed at the altar of "moving fast."

You have seen countless "revolutionary" technologies and the VPs who championed them come and go. You have watched as layer after layer of "modern" code has been piled on top of the stable, reliable systems you built. You know where the real business logic lives, and you know that humans are still the most important part of the stack.

You are, for all intents and purposes, a veteran who has seen it all.

**The Commitment (What We're Asking)**

This is a very low-commitment, consulting role. We respect your time and your experience. We are looking for your support in the following ways:

* **The Sanity Check:** We will occasionally send you a brief email with a fictional technical problem or a scene from our animated series, _FinTrade Corp_. We'll ask a simple question: "Does this feel real to you?"
* **The War Stories:** We are looking for your (completely anonymized) stories. The absurdities, the triumphs, the late-night saves, the ridiculous management requests. Your experiences are the foundation of our story.
* **The Voice of Experience:** Help us ensure our characters feel like real people you've worked with in the past.

That's it. A few emails a month. You can do it from anywhere, anytime. You chose your own level of involvement. Our production team works on Discord and you're more than invited to our VIP Lounge should you choose.

**Why We Need You**

We are creating a satirical show about the modern tech world, but we believe the heart of that world is the institutional knowledge of the people who built it. We want to get it right. We need your cynicism, your wisdom, and your stories to keep us honest.

**How to Express Interest**

There are no hoops to jump through. No resumes, no GitHub profiles, no portfolios.

**Simply reply to the email or message where you saw this.**

In your reply, tell us what your first computer was and your favorite thing to do on it.

We look forward to hearing from you.
