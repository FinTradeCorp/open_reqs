**Job Requisition: Digital Quartermaster

_This is a live requisition. We are looking for the first member of our technical staff. This is not just a job; it is a role in an ongoing narrative. If you don't understand what that means, this is not the role for you._

**Role / Title**

Digital Quartermaster

**Affiliation**

Project Mayhem / The FinTrade Corp Universe

**Background (The Ideal Candidate)**

You've spent years in the trenches. You've configured CI/CD pipelines at 2 AM, you've written Terraform scripts to automate away your own job, and you've seen firsthand how a single, misconfigured webhook can bring a system to its knees. You are fluent in the language of YAML, APIs, and log files.

But you're also tired of using your powers for building meaningless features and serving on-call rotations for systems you know are fundamentally broken. You have a satirical streak, a love for intricate puzzles, and you believe that the best way to explain a complex system is to build a smaller, working model of it. You understand that sometimes, the most important information is hidden in the commit history.

**Core Responsibilities (The "Narrative Function")**

Your job is to be the architect of our "blurry universe." You will build and maintain the technical infrastructure that connects our story to our community.

* **Automate the "Fight Club" HQ:** Rig our Discord server with bots and webhooks to create a seamless, automated experience. This includes integrating feeds from GitHub, Reddit, and YouTube.
* **Build the Artifacts:** Work directly with "Satoshi Durden" to create the interactive GitHub "Release Notes" for each episode. You will be responsible for crafting the realistic pull requests, the commit histories, and the "bad code" snippets that make our story feel real.
* **Manage the Infrastructure:** Ensure the stability and security of our community platforms. You will be the first and last line of defense for our digital clubhouse.
* **Hide the Easter Eggs:** You will be responsible for embedding secrets, clues, and hidden messages within our technical artifacts. You understand that a well-placed comment in a config file can be more powerful than a line of dialogue.

**Personality Beats (The "Culture Fit")**

* **A Master of Subtlety:** You understand that a quiet, deliberate change can have a massive impact. You know how to make a point without shouting.
* **Cynical but Hopeful:** You are deeply skeptical of corporate hype, but you still believe in the power of well-built, elegant systems.
* **A Digital Archaeologist:** You love digging through old code, documentation, and commit logs to find the "real" story of how something was built.
* **A Fellow Conspirator:** You get the joke. You understand the mission. You are here to help build the mirror, not to polish the chrome.

**Technical Stack (The "Visual Tags")**

* **Primary:** Discord API, GitHub Actions, Webhooks, Git
* **Secondary:** Python or Node.js (for scripting), YAML, Markdown
* **Bonus Points:** Experience with community management platforms, a deep love for esoteric command-line tools.

**How to Apply**

Do not send a resume.

Instead, create a public GitHub repository that contains a single Markdown file. In that file, provide a "Root Cause Analysis" for your favorite real-world, public tech outage.

Explain what you think _really_ happened, not what the company's official PR statement said.

Send a link to your repository to the email address listed on the r/satoshi_durden subreddit. We will be in touch.
